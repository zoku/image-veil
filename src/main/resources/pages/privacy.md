## Privacy policy

This is simple: We do not save any data. Not even logs with your IP in it. Nothing.

Even the image is processed in volatile memory only and is completely deleted afterwards. No temporary files, no shenanigans.

We do not use tracking. To keep an overview on how many people use the tool, we save a timestamp when an image is processed. Nothing more.

Most of the process takes place in your browser window. The upload only starts when you press "Anonymise!".
