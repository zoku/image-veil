# Instructions
You can use ImageVeil either with your mouse or with your finger and a device featuring a touchscreen.

1. Click or touch the dashed area and choose a file in the dialogue field. You can also drag and drop an image file (as of now we only support JPEG-images).
1. Click or touch the preview to add one or more pixelisation areas. You can resize them by dragging the edges and move them by dragging them at the centre. Delete them by clicking or touching the X button in the upper right corner of the area.
1. (Optional) In the upper left corner you now can open the option dialogue. Here you can choose a variety of options like the type of pixelisation and toggle anonymisation methods on or off. Default settings are safe!
1. Click on 'START' to begin with the anonymisation process. Your image will be transferred to our server and edited.
1. Once the editing process finished, the anonymised image will be displayed. To save it, right click on it and choose "Save image as..." or tap and hold the image with your finger to save it to your device.
