# How to use
You can use ImageVeil either with your mouse or with your fingertip on a device featuring a touchscreen.

1. Click or touch the dashed area and choose a file. You can also drag a file onto it (at the moment we only support JPEG-images).
1. Click or touch the preview image to add one or more pixelisation areas. You can resize them by dragging the sides and move them by dragging the center. Delete them by clicking or touching the X button in the upper right corner of the area.
1. (Optional) In the upper left corner you can open the options dialogue. There you can choose the type of pixelisation and toggle anonymisation methods on or off. The presets are safe!
1. Choose 'Start' to start the anonymisation process. Your image will be transferred to our server and will be edited.
1. When the editing process is finished, the anonymised image will be shown to you. To save it, right click on it and choose "Save image as..." or tap and hold the image with your finger to save it to your device, if you are using a touch screen.
