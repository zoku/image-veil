## How to use
### Anonymisation
1. Click on the area with the dashed outline and in the following dialogue select a file, or drag an image file (at the moment we only support JPEG-files) onto it.
1. If needed, left click on the preview image, hold the mouse button and pull open a frame. The contents of this frame will be pixelated in the anonymised image. Repeat until all areas which musn't be recognisable later are couvered.
1. To delete a frame simply left click it. It will vanish.
1. Choose a type of pixelation from the list below the preview image or choose 'None' to not pixelate any area.
1. Click on 'Anonymise!' to start the anonymisation process. Your image will be transferred to our server and be edited.
1. When the editing process is finished, your anonymised and pixelated image will be shown to you. To save it, right click it and select 'Save image as...'.

### What does the app do different than the others?
In addition to pixelisation and removal of meta data like EXIF-tables, we try to prevent scientific image analysis which could be used to identify the exact chip which has been used to record the image (see [Image analysis](image-analysis?l=en)). To do this we add a barely visible, random noise to the image, which overlays the noise inherent in the camera chip, making it invisible to the analysis software.
