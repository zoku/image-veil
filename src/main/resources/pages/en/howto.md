## How to use
Just drag you image onto the marked area or click the area to pop up a file dialogue.

After that, click and drag your mouse over the image to select areas you want to pixelate.

When you are ready, choose a type of pixelation and click "Anonymise!" to start the process.

The app will present the finished image to you and you can save it by right-clicking it and selecting "Save image as...".
